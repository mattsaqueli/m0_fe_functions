# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

 Im currently working on this area, I often get caught up on assignments that Im not quite understanding or know how to properly type out and lose track of time.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A functions can be thought as a bag, you can put instructions in that bag so when you give that bag to a person(program) it can follow your instructions.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

Parameters act like placeholders.
Arugements are actual data for when you call that function.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?

How are my small team members laying out their functions, specifically for the last challenge of the "functions.js". I was having a bit of trouble with that one.
